Dataset Used is - https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz

Aim - To test different imagenet pretrained models on flower dataset for multiclass classification.

Dataset- Dataset contains images of 5 different types such as - Daisy , Dandelion , Roses , Sunflowers , Tulips.
         We divided the dataset in training data and test data with 80% data would be used for training the model and 20% data would be used for test the model.
         There were total 3670 images out of which 2936 will be used for training and rest 734 images would be used for test.


Model Definition-   4 different imagenet pretrained models we have used. 
1)Resnet50
2)Xception
3)VGG16
4)InceptionV3

In all 4 cases , we kept the weights on imagenet dataset , we kept include_top = False which means dont keep 
fully connected layer of original model that was used to train on ImageNet dataset.Gave input to the model with size 180 * 180 * 3 which means
grid size of image is 180 * 180 and it is a RGB image.We used batch_normalization , dropout of 0.3 and l2 regularization to avoid overfitting in the model.
Output layer has 5 neurons as we have 5 classes in the dataset.Activation function of output layer is Softmax as it is a Multiclass Classification Problem.
We compiled all 4 models with Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.001 , loss of sparse_categorical_crossentropy with  metrics as accuracy. We trained all 4 models 
with 25 epochs and stored the log history in variable history. We have drawn train and validation accuracy and loss in two different graphs.For prediction on unseen image , 
download one of the image from available class , 
upload it in google collab and paste the path of image in [image = cv2.imread('/content/tulipse.jpeg')].
